## Steps 
After the installation is complete, run the Tableau desktop application. When the application loads, select 'Microsoft Excel' under 'Connect' and 'To a File' since we are working with excel datasheet. 

After the datasheet is processed, double-click on 'New Union' to open the Union pop-up. Drag and drop the three excel sheets (First 3rd, Middle, Last 3rd) and click 'Apply' to create a Union of our three datasheets. Click automatic update. 

Drag and drop the Region Key besides the Union to create an inner join. Region gets added to the datasheet along with the already present Region Key. As we are using maps in our sheets, to make the region clear, click on the 'Abc' and select Geographic Role, then select Country/Region. Then click on Sheet1 on the bottom navigation bar to bring up your new empty worksheet. You can rename the worksheet by double clicking on the tab. For the first worksheet rename it Average Age. On the left under the Measures sections you will see Age. Drag and drop Age to the Text Icon in the Marks section. You should see this: 


Click on the New Story icon besides the New Dashborad icon to create a story. Drag and drop each sheet to the top half of the window (besides 'Add a Caption') to create a story from our sheets. It is important that we drag each of the sheets to the top window because if we drag and drop it on the bottom window, it will replace the sheet you dragged prior to the new one. You can add a bief caption to each sheet you drag to the window by clicking on 'Add a Caption'. The caption is simply a story about the sheet. 

If you followed all the aforementioned steps, your story should look something like this.
